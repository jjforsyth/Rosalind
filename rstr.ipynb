    "Our aim in this problem is to determine the probability with which a given motif (a known promoter, say) occurs in a randomly constructed genome. Unfortunately, finding this probability is tricky; instead of forming a long genome, we will form a large collection of smaller random strings having the same length as the motif; these smaller strings represent the genome's substrings, which we can then test against our motif.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a probabilistic event A, the complement of A is the collection Ac of outcomes not belonging to A. Because Ac takes place precisely when A does not, we may also call Ac \"not A.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple example, if A is the event that a rolled die is 2 or 4, then Pr(A)=13. Ac is the event that the die is 1, 3, 5, or 6, and Pr(Ac)=23. In general, for any event we will have the identity that Pr(A)+Pr(Ac)=1.\n",

    "**Given:** A positive integer N≤100000, a number x between 0 and 1, and a DNA string s of length at most 10 bp.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return:** The probability that if N random DNA strings having the same length as s are constructed with GC-content x (see “Introduction to Random Strings”), then at least one of the strings equals s. We allow for the same random string to be created more than once.\n",
